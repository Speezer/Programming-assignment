            <h2>Network Security Degree Objectives</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1.Create a network infrastructure design communications document that includes identified hardware
                    components,
                    connections to the outside world, identified physical layer connectivity (media) and addressing,
                    including operational and
                    security components in the design.</li>
                <li>2. Install, configure and test security hardware and software tools with supporting documentation
                    such
                    as port scanners,
                    vulnerability detection systems, intrusion detection systems, firewalls, system hardening,
                    anti-virus
                    tools, patch
                    management, auditing and assessment.</li>
                <li>3. Construct, implement and document a script or a program to automate a security-related process or
                    other tasks such as
                    installation, administration, management, mapping resources, logon scripts, patch management,
                    updates,
                    auditing,
                    analysis and assessment.</li>
                <li>4. Create a policy or procedure that addresses events such as: a disaster recovery plan, a business
                    continuity plan, an
                    incident response policy, an acceptable usage document, an information security policy, a physical
                    security policy,
                    assessments or troubleshooting procedures.</li>
                <li>5. Develop a research report or implementation plan concerning legal and ethical best practices and
                    mandated requirements
                    that pertain to information security.</li>
                <li>6. Research, document, test and evaluate several current industry information security-based
                    threats,
                    risks, malicious
                    activities, covert methodology, encryption technologies, mitigation techniques or unconventional
                    tactics
                    to prevent loss of
                    sensitive information and data confidentiality, integrity and availability</li>
